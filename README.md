## ECDF of Completion Parameter by Performance Quantiles

### Start: [ECDF by Qunatiles](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/charkow-ecdf_quantiles_demo-ruh6h5dg/lab)
### Usage:
- Open Index.ipynb
- **Run**: Kernel --> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells
- Dropdown menu: select completion parameter to investigate
- Plot interactivity:
    - Zoom, pan , select
    - Click on legend to remove/add ECDF

### What is this good for?
- identification of correlation thresholds
- identification of correlation windows
- guidance for binning or bins validation

### Diagnostic Patterns:
- clear performance pattern: sequential progression from top to bottom quantiles
- thresholds where quantiles cross or coalesce
- correlation window: upper and lower correlation thresholds
- no pattern: quantiles overlap
